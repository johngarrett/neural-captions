### neural captions
- problem:
    - captions cause you to stare at the bottom of the screen and not pay attention
- idea:
    - pin captions to relevant object
        - `movement ?? talking ?? static object during movement ?? bottom of screen`
    - display captions as they occur; as the person is talking
